# About
## About me:
My name is Idan,
I am from the [Sagi Lab](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/Biological_Regulation/IritSagi/home) in the weizmann institute.
I am a novice coder with the over-all goal of finding ways to incorporate programing into my more biological projects.

## Reason for this site:
This site is a place where I will be testing the usefullness of even haveing a website.
I will be uploading notes as well as update my progress with exersism.
Lastly, I **will** *be* 'testing' ---all--- ~~sorts~~ of formating and [configuration](https://idanadir.github.io/) options.
